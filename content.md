## Attitude

### Title section

Attitude.

Your attitude plays a major role in who you become.
Lets find out how you can change your attitude to make you a better person.

### Section-1

To talk about attitude, we must first talk about personality.

A persons personality can be viewed like an iceberg. Only one-tenth of an iceberg is visible above the surface of water. 90% of the iceberg is underwater.
Our personality is like an iceberg.
The part of your personality that is visible to the world, is your knowledge, skills and behaviour.
The invisible 90%, is your attitude.

### Section 2

How does your attitude influence your life?

Your attitude is comprised of:

- Your values
- Your standards
- Your ethics
- Your judgements
- Your motives
- Your beliefs

Your values, standards, ethics, judgements, motives and beliefs, have an impact on your behaviour. And your behaviour is visible to the world.

### Section 3

What influences your attitude?

Three factors affect your attitude: the environment around you, your education and your experience.
Your environment plays the biggest role in your attitude.
A negative environment, other people's behaviour, a changing environment, a negative world view and past experience, all influence your attitude.

### Section 4

How can you manage your attitude?

Simple. Have a positive outlook towards life.
If you believe you can do something, you can definitely do it and no one will be able to stop you.
Don't think about the right or wrong decision. Take a decision and make it right.
